This repo is created for aosp riscv64 porting work.

There are some huge repositries for aosp projects, and due to github/gitee limitation(for example, single file size or total repo size for free users), I finally decide to use this ugly method to track my changes for these huge repos without touch them: just store the files (modified or new) in this separated repo and overwrite/copy them to the originl repos before building.

Considring the changes till now I found related to these huge repos are small, I hope this can fix current problem I am facing with.

FIXME, if you have better idea, thanks in adv.
